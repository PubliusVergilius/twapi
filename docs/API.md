# API like Twitter but uses HATEOS

### The user Tweet timeline and user mention timeline endpoints allow you to get Posts using the user ID. In order to get the user ID from a username, you can use the new user lookup endpoint v2. Replace the USER_NAME with the username of your choice and XXXX with your own bearer token that you obtained.

`curl --request GET 'https://api.x.com/2/users/by/username/USER_NAME --header 'Authorization: Bearer XXXXXX'`
